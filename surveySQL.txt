### Creating a Database--

>> create database userstatements;

### To use the database--

>> use userstatements;


### Creating table using Primary key--

>> create table users (userid int not null auto_increment, name varchar(55) not null, email varchar(55) not null, primary key (userid));

# int means the datatype of the field is integer(Number).
# not null means the value of the field can not be null.
# auto_increment means the value of the field should be automatically increased for next records.
# varchar(55) means the datatype is string and no. of letter upto 55.
# primary key (userid) means we are making our userid field as primary key.

### Creating table using Primary key and Foreign key--

>> create table userstmnts (stmntid int not null auto_increment primary key, name varchar(55) not null, age int not null, location varchar(55) not null, noofsubmission int not null default 0, uid int not null, foreign key(userid));

# foreign key(userid) we are adding the userid field of users table which is the primary key as the foreign key in uid field of userstmnts table.


Query1: SQL query to dig out the people who filled the survey from same location.

>> select distinct name from userstmnts where location = "Dhenkanal";

# distinct to get the different/unique data.
# where clause to implement the condition.



Query2: SQL query to find out the names who filled the survey more than 4 times.

>> select distinct name from userstmnts where noofsubmission > 4;


Query3: SQL query to find out the persons who filled the survey and their age is less than 30.

>> select distinct name from userstmnts where noofsubmission > 0 && age < 30;

# && to check 2 conditions.


Query4: SQL Query to fetch second record from table?

>> select * from userstmnts where stmntid = 2;


Query5: SQL query to find out the survey submission count for every people.

>> select distinct name, noofsubmission from userstmnts;
